                                        The best time to study varies by individual preferences and energy levels. Early
                                        mornings are ideal for some due to a
                                        fresh mind and fewer distractions, while others thrive in the evenings or late
                                        nights when it's quieter. Ultimately, the
                                        best time is when you're most alert, focused, and can maintain consistent study
                                        habits.
